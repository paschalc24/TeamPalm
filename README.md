This application aims to empower course staff with actionable insights, enabling them to effectively manage the forum, prioritize responses, and provide an enhanced learning experience for students.

#### Getting Started
Before proceeding, make sure you have the latest possible versions of the following software installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node.js + npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

#### Installing Dependencies
If you would like to set up a virtual environment before installing dependencies, instructions on how to do so can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). All necessary dependencies can be installed using the following command from the main directory `TeamPalm`:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt & npm i
```

To start the servers run (these commands can be run in separate terminal sessions as well):
```
python backend/manage.py runserver & npm run dev
```

If there are no issues, the server will boot up at [http://127.0.0.1:5173/](http://127.0.0.1:5173/), which should load up the login page for the application.

To end the servers you can kill the process with `Ctrl + C`.
