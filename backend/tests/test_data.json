I did some digging around in the tree visualization functions and at one point it does a check to see if the type of the node is a LeafNode or not. i have tried putting in print statements and it keeps coming up with that the Nodes are of type 'instance' but on the error it says it is trying to get an attribute from type LeafNode. can anyone provide any insight on this? If the console is outputting an error on a LeafNode why is the code not evaluating its type as a LeafNode?\n\nEdit: I found on stack overflow that this could be fixed by having all classes inherit object so i now have TreeNodeInterface() inherit object.
